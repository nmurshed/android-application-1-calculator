# A Simple Calculator Android Application



The main goal of this project is to get a first hand experience in android development environment.A basic CASIO MS-8L calculator is developed using basic functionality of Android Studio 2.2.

Functionalities Supported
------------------------
The calculator has two displays, one top and one bottom.The Top display shows the user inputs, where as the bottom display shows the final output.
At the first use, the user can type equation with multiple operands and operators.Once that is calculated, any other calculation is done on the final output.
The SquareRoot and Percentage button works on any number inserted by the user.Repeated pressing those buttons computes the function on the previous output.
Any numbers on the output display can be stored in the memory using (M+) buttons.once a number is in the memory, user can add any number to that memory by inserting a number and pressing (M+) again.Any number can be subtracted from the stored number using (M-) button.
User can recall the stored button to the display using Memory Recall (MRC) Button.
To clear the screen, user needs to click Clear(C) button.To clear display and any memory stored, All Clear(AC) has to be pressed.
To get a user friendly display, decimal places has been limited to 4 digits.For large numbers, exponential formatting has been used to representt the solution.
